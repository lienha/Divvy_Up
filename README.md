##WELCOME TO Divvy Up Tours


For our final Project at Dev Bootcamp, Chicago.

The project is a Rails app with primarily a JavaScript front end. It allows users to select
from a variety of tours of Chicago that can be easily taken on the city's new Divvy bikes.
Each tour has a route to ride, and points of interest to see. Clicking on a point of interest
brings up information about that location. They can also click the map to get the location of
the nearest Divvy station with information about the availability of bikes and open spots for
docking the bikes when the tour is finished.

The application uses Rails with a number of Gems, see the Gemfile for a complete list. There
is also Google maps, and jQuery, and Foundation, among other cool things.
